# This script contains the following: 

# A brief description of the issues with the datasets and why in needs to be rearranged 

# 1. Merging the training and the test data sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (#1 and #2 possibly can be done in reverse order)
 
# 3. Assigns descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Notes: 
# 1. the script is run from a given working directory
# 2. the scipu uses library {dplyr}
